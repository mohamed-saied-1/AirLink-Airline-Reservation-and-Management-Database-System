📌 Project Title:
AirLink – Airline Reservation and Management Database System

🧠 Description:
AirLink is a fully relational airline management database system designed to handle all core operations related to flights, passengers, bookings, check-ins, payments, and employees. The project includes full database design, implementation of SQL queries, and execution of complex transactions with integrity control.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Microsoft SQL Server / T-SQL

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)

🧪 Key Features:

ERD Modeling: Designed a normalized relational database for airline operations

DDL: Created tables with primary and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity

DML: Inserted, updated, and deleted realistic data for passengers, flights, bookings, and more

DCL: Defined user roles and managed access permissions (GRANT, REVOKE)

TCL: Used transactions with rollback mechanisms to ensure data consistency

Queries: Implemented joins, aggregations, and filters for report generation

Screenshots: Captured execution of SQL commands and outputs

🎯 What I Learned:

Designing complex relational databases from real-world scenarios

Writing advanced SQL queries and managing data integrity

Applying best practices in normalization and relational design

Handling user access control and transaction safety in database systems
